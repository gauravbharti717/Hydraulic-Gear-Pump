# ⚙️ Hydraulic Gear Pump Design Project

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a 3D CAD model and motion animation of an **external gear hydraulic pump**. These pumps are widely used in hydraulic circuits for delivering pressurized fluid to actuators, valves, and hydraulic cylinders.

This design demonstrates the **gear meshing principle** used for positive displacement of fluid and provides a visual reference for how suction and discharge occurs through gear rotation.
